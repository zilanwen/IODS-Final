# IODS-Final

Linear regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis(LDA) and Multiple correspondence analysis(MCA) were performed on the Data 'student alcohol consumption'. The data for each analysis was adjusted according to the varibles of interest. In order to explore the relationship between students grades and other variables, `Grade`, the average of G1, G2 and G3, was regards as target variable. However G3 was used as the target for LDA analysis because G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. In terms of MCA, eight categorized varibles were selected including `address`, `famsize`, `Pstatus`, `Mjob`, `Fjob`, `reason`, `guardian`, `high_use`.
